.. admonition:: Challenge: What is lateral thinking?

   Lateral thinking is, according to wikipedia, a *manner of solving problems using an indirect and creative approach via reasoning that is not immediately obvious. It is this moment of surprise, generating laughter and new insight, which facilitates the ability to see a different thought pattern which initially was not obvious.*

   **Examples of lateral thinking puzzles**

   (1) There is a man who lives on the top floor of a very tall building. Everyday he gets the elevator down to the ground floor to leave the building to go to work. Upon returning from work though, he can only travel half way up in the lift and has to walk the rest of the way unless it’s raining! Why?

   (2) A prisoner survived in a cell with no water. His only source of fresh water was from a well located on the other side of the thick steel door of his cell. How?    
   (3) A man and his son are in a car accident. The father dies on the scene, but the child is rushed to the hospital. When he arrives the surgeon says,”I can’t operate on this boy, he is my son!” How can this be?

   (4) A man is wearing black. Black shoes, socks, trousers, lumper, gloves and balaclava. He is walking down a black street with all the street lamps off. A black car is coming towards him with its light off but somehow manages to stop in time. How did the driver see the man?
